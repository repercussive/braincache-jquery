Braincache is a game designed to test your working memory. It's simple in concept - just click on words you haven't seen before - but it provides a neat challenge.

This version was created simply with HTML. CSS, JavScript & jQuery, but I also made alternative versions of the game using:

- React (click [here](https://github.com/repercussive/braincache-react))
- Vue (click [here](https://github.com/repercussive/braincache-vue))
- Svelte (click [here](https://github.com/repercussive/braincache-svelte))

Braincache is a game designed to test your working memory. It's simple in concept - just click on words you haven't seen before. However, it provides a neat challenge and shows just how much information our brains can juggle.

This version was created with HTML, CSS, JavaScript & jQuery, but I also made alternative versions of the game using:

- React (click [here](https://github.com/repercussive/braincache-react))
- Vue (click [here](https://github.com/repercussive/braincache-vue))
- Svelte (click [here](https://github.com/repercussive/braincache-svelte))
